        Hello and Welcome to the About Me page of this project. I am from
        Minnesota, USA. I have been in SheCodes Basic, Plus and now Responsive.
        I am excited to learn more about making pages and sites more repsonsive.
        After this program, I am signed up to do te React portion. I like the
        autumn and winter. I enjoy learning new things. I read each morning with
        my significant other. We have read collectively 16 books this year
        togeter. I have three pets, two cats and a dog. The cats are younger but
        the dog is old. He is actually starting to have issues with his back
        legs. I hope you enjoyed this page. If you would like to contact me, you
        may find my email below. As well, hope you have a wonder day and enjoy
        coding.
